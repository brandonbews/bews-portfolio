Early in my career, I remember being told "gray is gray." In our case, gray was 30+ shades of gray, many of them used in conflicting ways. For me, choosing a finite set of grays or neturals might be one of the most important aspects of a design, especially for a single color brand like YLighting. I like to have a point of view on contrast early on, as it informs so much accessiblitiy, usability, and hierarchy.

In addition to a thicket of grays, we also identified accessibility issues with YLighting's primary brand color, which happened to be **rgb(255,0,0)**, or as red you can get in the digital world. This created legibility problems in several contexts, but it was primarly an issue when red text was used against mid-tone backgrounds. This was due to a quirk in how humans perceive red, called chromostereopsis.

After a comprehensive discovery and exploration phase, I proposed a revised palette for the YLighting brand. This palette included seven new shades of gray in cooler tones, and a new red to be used primary brand color. This new red was also derived from a pantone, so it could applied across all digital and print channels, further unifying the brand.

In a paralell project&mdash;which I wont cover in much detail here&mdash;my team and I also redesigned the YLighting logo. A logo update had long been a goal of mine, and it felt like the perfect time with so much of the YLighting brand on the table.
