When the YDesign Group team and myself set out to redesign the YLighting homepage, it became apparent early on that we had a much larger opportunity. What started as a design refresh, quickly evolved into a broader system that could be used to unify our marketing efforts across the site. Not only would we seek to boost the marketing performance of the homepage, we would use the homepage as a starting point to create a series of modular components, guided by design standards that would be developed in parallel.

## The Design Phase

Before any design work could begin, the team took the time to build a matrix of business and hypothesized user goals. This enabled us to identify potential elements and keep our design aligned with our priorities as the process got more complex. From there, I produced a series of wireframes that were whittled down into a primary candidate.

There were several several key opportunities that guided the early design process. First, the current homepage structure was very inefficient from an operational perspective, needing constant design support as assets moved up and down the page or required updates to end date messaging. Because the size, shape, and text for all assets was heavily context dependent, it was also difficult to reuse them in other templates or marketing channels.

The second opportunity we idfentified was presenting more of YLighting's own brand story, values, and differetiators. The homepage was often ripe with content about sales happening now, but relatively light on content that spoke to the brand itself, and why a user could feel confident they'd found the right place to shop for high-end modern lighting.

I produced several versions of the homepage before the team landed on a design that we felt accomplished our goals. We would add space to reinforce YLighting's brand pillars just below the primary banner, provide a prominent category navigation to help user's find what they need quickly, and create a dedicate section for inspirational content. Confidence builders, like customer reviews and key policies, would receive a dedicated home. Most importantly, however, the page would from a system of design standards and components that could be used&mdash;and reused&mdash;quickly by our design team, across any template on site.
